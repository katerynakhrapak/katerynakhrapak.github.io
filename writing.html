      <h3>THE EARLY SUNSET</h3>
      <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px; ">His collar was covered in blood and ashes,<br>
      His hands were trembling as he was awkwardly trying to grasp for some air with his mouth.<br>
      The city horizon was caught in the fire,<br>
      The boy was not left untouched.<br>
      Lying on the wet ground, he, as a bird, was dreaming about the sky.<br>
      He strived to understand why he, being seventeen years old, was forced to be blinded by the fire.<br>
      Why was there no air left for him?<br>
      Why did someone decide to steal his tomorrow?<br>
      Yesterday, he was happy in the same shirt, laying right there,<br>
      Just looking above and fervently adoring the sky, which has always been alluring to him,<br>
      However, the collar of his snowy white shirt was not red.<br>
      He believed that in his eightieth he would still be lying there, remembering the wildflowers.<br>
      He definitely had never thought that the field would absorb him even before sunset,<br>
      That the flowers will sprout from his eyes.<br>

      The city of the burnt landscapes,<br>
      Hundreds of days were lost there,<br>
      Minds were neglected, and bodies were lost,<br>
      This frequently happens when there is a war.</p>

      <h3 style="padding-top: 60px;">WHEN YOU SEE LIGHT, LOOK FOR A SHADOW</h3>
      <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px; ">
        <em>Water. Caprate. Glycerin. Cetearyl Alcohol. Sunflower Seed Oil. Shea butter and fragrance of a pine forest.</em><br>
2008. "Everybody Dances" aired on Ukrainian television. Dasha was three. That was probably the first time she got goosebumps as she watched someone dance. The contestants conquered the scene with different styles of dances, fighting for victory. She would forget to breathe in watching people dance, watching people feel and talk with their bodies. That is when she started to spend every Friday evening sitting in a living room in front of the TV watching the program, trying to repeat the movements, and composing her own dances during the advertising break. Her mom would stand behind the glass door, smiling, and film Dasha's first attempts to do plies and pirouettes.
After a few months Dasha came to her mom after one of the "Everybody Dances" episode and asked, "Can I become a dancer?" Her mom smiled, hugged her tightly and whispered in the ear, "You can become anything you want."
A week later she was standing with her feet freezing and hair slicked back in a dance hall. Full of expectations, dreams and slight fear. Smiling to herself in the mirror.<br>
<em>Ten bony fingers struggle to open a tube of a hand cream. Her hands look more like autumn stems of flowers.</em><br>
2013. Hearing the cheerful screams of the children in the yard, she was in her flat packing a bag for a ballet school. Water bottle, tights, hairbrush, bobby pins and, most importantly, hand cream. Even though Dasha liked her dance classes, she wished to be six floors below, playing with friends, running, and screaming, forgetting the routine, rules, and dance movements. With music blasting in her headphones, she passed through her friends playing, to avoid temptation of skipping a class and joining them. She breathed in the warmth of the beginning of September. It meant two things: the summer is over, and childhood is over too.
In the dancing school, they never cared about her dream. The teachers made it clear that she was not special. When Dasha was getting carried away with the music, with the feeling of sound vibrations moving through her body, from toe to ear, and do an extra turn, or passionately throw her hand at the wrong direction, she would get yelled at. "Do not forget the rules; forget about what you feel. You will be able to dance your movements when you will be worth something, until then do what is in the choreography." Dasha could not wait until that day. The day she will make her body free. The day she will dance her thoughts aloud.<br>
<em>As she takes the cover off and squishes silky cream on to her right hand, she feels the gentle smell of rain drops, pine trees and wet ground, and she closes her eyes.</em><br>
2018. Five years and four dancing styles later, Dasha was still doing ballet. She had an important rehearsal that evening; it was the last one before the auditions to Kyiv Municipal Academy of Dance. Dasha believed she would pass; her teacher, however, didn't. After the four-hour rehearsal the thirst was making her eyes water. She was counting the seconds before she could drink the water that had probably become warm from the blazing heat inside the class. As she thirstily empted the bottle, her teacher said, "Dasha, we girls with short and bulky legs do not have chances in the high ballet, no matter how much we try."
Dasha had to pinch herself not to cry. She smiled, apologized and left. She didn't have dinner that day. Since then, she skipped her food occasionally and counted every calorie she consumed. Those words indeed stamped in her memory. Anytime her friends would ask her to join them for a coffee, she would not go. She was scared she would have to eat something or even worse â€“ explain why she would not eat anything. Instead, she would stay home and go through the pictures of perfect dancers, with perfect bodies on Pinterest. She would come across quotes that added to her motivation. Quotes that added to her struggle. "Nothing tastes as good as thin feels." "You are not hungry; you are just bored." "Be disciplined" echoed in her head whenever she felt her stomach grumble, or she saw her favorite food in the market.
She was not successful in that audition. She spent the next two years in the same dancing school. Practicing her moves and resistance. It was always "I am fine thanks." It was always a smile. Whenever people criticized her, whenever praised. She would not show pain or extreme happiness. She was disciplined, strong. She thought it would be enough. She hoped she was enough. Will be enough. Soon.<br>
<em>She spreads the cream all around the hands, so that it moisturizes all the cracks in her thin, dry skin. The favorite scent transfers her to the forest. She is breathing in the crisp air of solitude, standing there barefoot. She dreams about being a bird; weightlessly dancing with him, with the wind. She indeed could be a bird: an eagle or a sparrow. But she was born a human.</em><br>
2020. Dasha was in Kyiv, studying choreography in Kyiv National University of Culture and Art. She lived six hours away by train from family. She was sixteen and she cooked her own dinner; those days when she did not skip it. Dasha never complained though. It was her dream. Apparently, she started to like monotonous routine. Every day, she was waking up in a flat on the tenth floor when it was still dark outside. Then she went to the bathroom, hoping that there would be hot water in the tub. Usually there was none. Cold water refreshed her face and cleared her mind.
During her one-hour bus trip to the university, Dasha caught up with her sleeping routine; sometimes leaning on the cold glass window of a bus that seemed to be the only protection from the harsh winter outside, sometimes laying her head on someone's shoulder, accidentally. People looked at her strangely, but she did not really care; she was tired.
The winter seemed to be eternal. She spent her evenings sitting on the windowsill gazing at the sky, counting the windows with the light still on. She liked to see how the busy city goes to sleep, before she does. She felt control, eternity, and safety. Then she bathed. Soaking in the warm water for fourty minutes, she felt a new callus on her foot. A new one, but definitely not the first. She got used to it. She got used to being tired.<br>
<em>She finally opens her eyes. The skin absorbed the cream. Her feet are cold, as always. She starts to move her toes, tightly fitted into pointe shoes, in circular motions. Dasha looks at the huge curtain that separates her and 200 hundred pairs of eyes eagerly waiting to see her perform.</em><br>
2022. Dasha was really close with her mother. Living in another city was quite a challenge to her. She would spend twelve hours in total on the train to visit her family every other weekend. In fact, she liked trains a lot. She liked to have an excuse to spend all those minutes laying on the top bunk of a compartment, listening to stranger's conversations or looking out of the dirty window.
She never could have thought that she would have to move abroad, alone. Not because of her dream, not because she wanted to, but because the war started. She found herself in Kosice, Czech Republic, finishing her education in the Dancing Academy.
Things were different this time. She didn't have to have a dinner alone, as she lived in the dormitory. She always had people around. Yet, those people were strangers to her. No matter how much she tried, she could not understand them, neither could they understand her, but not the language, the thoughts. Their thoughts were foreign. Or maybe she didn't belong?
On the eve of Christmas that year she could not be with her family. She had to participate in a performance from her dancing academy. They wouldn't let her go home as it would take more than 40 hours in bus. That evening, she was wandering around dozens of stalls overloaded with useless Christmas stuff. Flashing garlands, Christmas tree decorations of all the shapes possible, gingerbread cookies. Everything she likes so much. It didn't bring joy to her anymore. She was angry instead. She was angry at people for having fun, not feeling her pain, forgetting about the war raging a hundred kilometers from here. She wanted to scream or cry. Loud enough to lose her voice and not having to talk ever again. Instead, she decided to call her mom. Her calming voice and ability to listen without judgment always comforted Dasha.
The annoying pip, pip, pip, on the phone was driving her crazy. She tried to call her father. Or Brother. No one would pick up. Her breath became quicker. She felt light dizziness deep inside head. She could not help but think that something bad could happen, that a Russian missile could hit her house this time. She felt she could faint. Because of fear, or anger, or frustration, or self-pity.
There was only one other way left for Dasha to splash out emotions, come to senses. To dance. She headed to the training room in the academy as it was open around the clock. She pushed the huge wooden doors. With a shrill creak they moved, opening a view of a long, empty room, lit by the moonlight. She took her shoes off, stepped on the floor barefoot. It was cold, just like the first time she ever entered a dancing hall. Just like every time she enters a dancing hall. With no music and other light than moon she danced. To the rhythm of own breath, with her hair untied. She was free, she was herself.
She has never danced more passionately than that time. Somehow dancing movements that bruised her body, therapeutically were healing her heart. She felt like a bird, like there were no limits, no physical boundaries, and no ground.<br>
But then she fell.<br>
And there was ground.<br>
And it hurt.<br>
<em>She hears the first chords of the symphony, rubs her hands, and smells the pine fragrance of the cream at last. She puts her best smile on the face. Inhales. The audience of Milan theater will see her flawless plies and pirouettes in a few seconds.</em><br>

      <h3>MIDNIGHT</h3>
      <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px; padding-left: 40px;">
Let's listen to the longest nights,<br>
Where loneliness can not catch us up, and the light only interfere.<br>
Those nights when clumsy fingers get lost in the threatening heat,<br>
And the eyes frantically look for the darkest corners.<br>
Maybe there will be answers to the question "why"?<br>
Then it will become clear why woolen socks are the best gift for Christmas,<br>
And why the importance of gazes will never be lost,<br>
And why the phenomenon of human smiles, the morning sun or the first touches will be described differently each time.<br>
Always ommiting the most important definitions,<br>
Calling heat a physical phenomenon, considering the coincidences to be accidental.<br>
Nights are valuable for the pounding of the heart, which reflects off the empty walls of a one-room apartment in the center of some city,<br>
Pounding that muffles any displays of human intellectual development.<br>
Nights will openly shout what you are most afraid to hear,<br>
Things you already know.<br></p>
